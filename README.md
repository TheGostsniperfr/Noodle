# Noodle 🍜

Take the spaghetti out of a large architecture and keep it clear.

Noodle turns an architecture described as code into readable, presentation-grade
diagrams, and aims further: interactive views, guided tours, visual PR diffs, discovery
from real clusters, live overlays, and a model AI agents can query.
See [the vision](docs/VISION.md).

![CNP runtime example](examples/cnp-runtime/runtime.dark.png)

## Status

**Contracts `v1alpha1`.** A system is a model (what exists), views (what each diagram
shows) and layouts (where a topology is drawn), rendered to draw.io in a dark or light
theme. Five view types: topology, sequence, landscape (tech stack), catalog (service
catalogue) and matrix (who may act on what, before and after a plan). noodle refuses to emit a diagram whose lines cross boxes, whose labels
collide, or whose arrows break the connection semantics. Next: static discovery from
Kubernetes manifests ([roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

## Install

### As a Claude Code plugin (skill + `noodle` command)

```
/plugin marketplace add TheGostsniperfr/Noodle
/plugin install noodle@noodle
```

Then enable auto-update once, under **Marketplaces** in `/plugin`, to follow `main`.
The plugin puts `noodle` on the PATH. On first use it builds itself from the plugin's
sources with Go, or with Nix; a `noodle` already on the PATH wins. PNG and SVG exports
also need [draw.io desktop](https://www.drawio.com/) (`drawio`).

To offer it to everyone working in a repository, run once there and commit the result:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add TheGostsniperfr/Noodle --scope project
```

### With Nix

```nix
inputs.noodle.url = "github:TheGostsniperfr/Noodle";
# then: home.packages = [ inputs.noodle.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];
```

or just `nix run github:TheGostsniperfr/Noodle -- -list-icons`.

## Usage

```bash
noodle render architecture/platform -view runtime                          # check and lint only
noodle render architecture/platform -view runtime -theme dark -o out.drawio  # then render
noodle render architecture/platform -view runtime -icons .noodle/icons -slide  # project icons, drawing only
noodle migrate old-spec.yaml architecture/platform                        # a v0 single file, once
helm template my-release chart/ | noodle discover k8s - -o architecture/platform/discovered/k8s-helm.yaml
noodle -list-icons
drawio -x -f png -s 2 --border 20 -o out.png out.drawio
```

The format is in [the skill reference](skills/noodle-diagram/reference.md).

## Examples

| System | Shows |
|---|---|
| [`cnp-runtime`](examples/cnp-runtime) | one model, two views: the runtime topology and the OIDC login sequence |
| [`sequence-basics`](examples/sequence-basics) | every sequence step kind: messages, a relay against a tunnel, a note, replies |
| [`landscape`](examples/landscape) | a tech stack: bands, a side column, a pipeline, planned items with a target |
| [`catalog`](examples/catalog) | a service catalogue built from the model's offerings |
| [`topology-diff`](examples/topology-diff) | a proposal drawn as a diff: what it adds and removes over the dimmed platform, next to the reference view of the same model |
| [`cnp-access`](examples/cnp-access) | an access matrix from memberships and grants: what a segregation plan changes, phase by phase |
| [`platform-regression`](examples/platform-regression) | three large topologies from a real platform, kept as regression fixtures |

## Development

```bash
nix develop
./scripts/init.sh        # vet, test, lint the example, validate the plugin, show next features
```

Dependencies are vendored (`go mod vendor`) so the plugin can build offline. Run
`go mod vendor` after changing `go.mod`.
