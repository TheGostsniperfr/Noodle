description: Create or update an architecture diagram with noodle, in the house style (Tailwind dark/light palettes, official logos, port badges, lint-enforced readability, draw.io + PNG output). Use when asked for an architecture, flow, deployment or security diagram of a system, or when a change to a system should be reflected in an existing diagram.

# Architecture diagrams with noodle

Diagrams are generated, not drawn. The source of truth is a YAML spec (v0 format, see
`examples/`); `noodle` turns it into a `.drawio` file and refuses to emit it while the
lint finds a collision. Hand edits in draw.io are for throwaway variants only; a canonical change
goes through the spec so the palette, the IDs and the PR diff stay consistent.

## Workflow

1. **Facts first.** Read the code that implements what the diagram shows (Helm
   templates, Terraform, K8s manifests), not only `docs/`. When code and docs disagree,
   draw the code, add `badge: Gx` on the node and an entry in the "Gaps" card.
2. **One question per diagram.** Write it as the subtitle. Anything that does not help
   answer it goes to "Out of scope" in `meta`.
3. **Write the spec in English** (proper nouns aside), then lint and build both themes:
   ```bash
   B=<out-dir>/<id> I=<noodle-repo>/.claude/skills/noodle-diagram/icons
   for t in dark light; do
     noodle -theme $t -icons $I -o $B.$t.drawio <spec-dir>/<id>.yaml
     drawio -x -f png -s 2 --border 20 -o $B.$t.png $B.$t.drawio
   done
   ```
4. **Look at the PNG.** The lint catches geometry, not taste.
5. For the docs, export the editable SVG:
   `drawio -x -f svg --embed-diagram -o $B.$t.drawio.svg $B.$t.drawio`.
   The PNG is the one to paste in chats.

## Semantics

- **An arrow is a connection, drawn from the side that opens it (client) to the side
  that listens (server).** Traffic carried back over a connection opened the other way,
  such as a tunnel, is said in the label ("[2] relayed via tunnel ◀").
- **Draw requests only, never responses.** When a specific response changes the path
  (302, 401, 500, retry), write it as a note next to the component that sends it
  ("Without a session, Envoy replies 302 to auth…"), not as a return arrow.
- **Topology and sequence are separate diagrams.** A structural diagram numbers only the
  nominal path, with one step per connection and each step used once; the lint rejects
  anything else. A flow that reuses connections or goes back and forth (OIDC login,
  token exchange, retries, sagas) gets its own sequence diagram. Its connections stay on
  the topology, unnumbered, with a label pointing to that sequence.
- **Egress leaves from the right or bottom border, ingress enters on the left or top.**
  The lint enforces it. `against_flow: true` is the only exception, for outbound
  connections that run against the reading direction: tunnels, agents calling home, a
  hairpin to a public endpoint. Use it knowingly.
- **`port:` is the listening port**, drawn as a badge straddling the server's border,
  like `TCP 8080` or `UDP 7844`. Client ports are ephemeral and are not drawn.
- **Arrow label: `[step] verb · protocol`**, like `[6] proxy · HTTP`. The port is on the
  badge, so it is not repeated in the label.
- **Numbers `[1]…[n]` are the request path (data plane), in time order. Letters `[A]…`
  are background work (control plane):** tunnels, syncs, operators. Two cards list them.
- **`kind: link` is an object reference** (parentRef, targetRef, envFrom, secret name).
  It is dotted, has an open arrow, carries no step and ignores the side rule.
- **Node text is the C4 triptych:** `title` in bold, `tech` in brackets and italics,
  `desc` as one line about the component's responsibility. Technical specifics go in
  the step and gap cards, not in the box.

## Visual language

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Node `kind` | `frontend` cyan · `backend` emerald (services, routing) · `database` violet (data and secrets) · `cloud` amber (edge, tunnels, providers) · `security` rose (identity, policies) · `bus` orange · `external` slate |
| Node `icon` | Official logo when the box is a product (`cloudflare`, `envoy`, `keycloak`, `vault`, `cnpg`, `argo`, `cilium`, `kubernetes`). Kubernetes resource icon (`k8s-svc`, `k8s-deploy`, `k8s-pod`, `k8s-secret`, `k8s-ns`, `k8s-sa`, `k8s-crd`) when the box is a K8s object. CRDs without an official icon use `k8s-crd`, as Argo CD does. |
| Node `shape` | `box` default · `cylinder` for a datastore · `actor` for a human |
| Zone `kind` | `region` = infra or trust perimeter. `group` = functional category, named by role first ("GATEWAY API", "IDENTITY", "SECRETS"), namespace in `sub`. |
| Zone `icon` | Always set. Environment on regions (`globe` internet, `cloudflare` SaaS, `rack` on-prem, a provider logo for a cloud), product or `k8s-ns` on groups. |
| Zone `color` | Sibling zones get different colours so boundaries read at a glance. |
| Edge `kind` | `flow` connection · `auth` authentication · `tunnel` outbound tunnel set up in advance · `async` background sync · `blocked` must not happen · `link` reference |

Palettes are Tailwind v3: 400 strokes on slate-950 for dark, 600 strokes on 50 fills for
light, both checked for WCAG AA text contrast. Colour is never the only carrier: kind is
also shown by icon, dash pattern and legend. Icons live in `icons/`. Add `<name>.svg`
from the CNCF artwork repo, the Kubernetes community icon set or simple-icons, recoloured
with the brand colour. Add `<name>.dark.svg` / `<name>.light.svg` when one variant
disappears on a background.

## Layout and cable management

- Leave **60–80 px corridors between zones**. Edges travel in corridors, never through
  a zone they do not serve. Inside a zone, 24 px minimum between nodes.
- Every edge has an explicit orthogonal `path` whose first and last points sit on the
  borders of `from` and `to`. No diagonals. Keep port badges clear of the node icon, top-left.
- **Backbones, not spaghetti.** When several edges go the same way, give them parallel
  lanes 15–20 px apart in the same corridor and turn them together, like a PCB bus or
  cable management in a rack. Fan out only at the last bend before each target.
- Put a label on the longest straight segment, or set `label_at` on the drawn path in a
  clear spot. Never on a bend, a box, a zone title, a port badge or another line.
- A perpendicular crossing is fine: draw.io draws a bridge. Two edges running on top of
  each other are not: the lint rejects it.
- Flow reads left to right: actors → edge/SaaS → cluster → data.

## Required parts

Title with a one-line question, scope and out-of-scope lines, version, source path.
Cards under the diagram: `Legend` (`legend: true`, generated from the kinds used),
`Request path · data plane`, `Background · control plane`, and `Gaps between docs and
code` when there are any.

## Stable IDs

IDs are semantic (`envoy-shared-gateway`, `e-4-connector-envoy`) and never renamed for
cosmetic reasons. The PR diff matches elements across versions by ID.
